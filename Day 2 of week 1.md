Today was Day 2 of my #HarkiratCohort journey, and I found inspiration in Autobiography of a Yogi and Premanand Maharaj’s teachings. I’ve started chanting the name of divine power, as Maharaj suggests—it brings immense focus and enlightenment. I believe we should all nurture four areas: physical health, mental clarity, emotional well-being, and #TechSkills, with #Spirituality as a separate, essential focus for everyone.

What I Did Today: I created a wireframe for a famous website featuring an interest calculator. Think clean design, functional layout—something users rely on daily.

Failures I Faced: Spacing Issues—My initial wireframe looked cramped. I misjudged how much white space matters for usability. Overthinking Features—Tried adding too many extras (fancy buttons!), which distracted from the core calculator focus.

Lessons Learned: Clarity is King—Proper spacing makes a design breathe—learned this after redoing it twice! Stick to Purpose—Extra flair is nice, but the interest calculator’s utility comes first. Simplicity drives impact. Chanting Helps—Repeating divine names kept me calm and focused while troubleshooting my mistakes.

This #LearnInPublic process is humbling. Day 2 of the #HarkiratCohort showed me how #WireframeDesign ties into real-world tools, while chanting (inspired by #PremanandMaharaj) sharpens my mind. How do you blend personal focus with #WebDevelopment? Let’s chat! #CodingJourney #SelfImprovement
