Today, I dove into Day 1 with the #HarkiratCohort, focusing on #JavaScript fundamentals. Hereâ€™s what I learned, with some challenges overcome along the way:

## 03:05 - Why Languages?
Understanding why programming languages exist and their role in solving problems. Itâ€™s the foundation of why we code!

## 09:29 - Interpreted vs Compiled Languages
Learned the difference: interpreted languages like #JavaScript run directly, while compiled ones (e.g., C++) get translated first. JSâ€™s flexibility clicked for me here.

## 26:18 - Why JS >> Other Languages?
Explored what makes #JavaScript shine in #WebDevelopmentâ€”its versatility across front-end and back-end (thanks, Node.js!). Itâ€™s everywhere for a reason.

## 27:50 - Strict vs Dynamic Languages
JS is dynamically typedâ€”variables can change types on the fly. Compared to strict languages like Java, itâ€™s more forgiving but tricky to debug sometimes.

## 30:17 - Single-threaded Nature of JS
Unpacked how JS handles tasks with one thread using the event loop. Took me a bit to grasp concurrency here, but I got it sorted!

## 35:50 - Simple Primitives in JS (Loops, Variables, etc.)
Got hands-on with basics: loops (for, while), variables (let, const, var). Simple but essential building blocks.

## 56:00 - Complex Primitives in JS (Arrays, Objects)
Leveled up to arrays and objectsâ€”JSâ€™s way of handling data structures. Playing with them felt like unlocking new tools.

## 01:09:56 - Functions
Mastered functions as reusable code blocks. Writing my own and seeing them work was satisfying!

## 01:16:18 - Break
A quick breatherâ€”coding is intense!

## 01:24:44 - Callback Functions
Tackled callbacks for asynchronous JS. This was a hurdleâ€”understanding how functions wait for othersâ€”but I nailed it after some practice.

Faced some bumps (callbacks and single-threaded concepts were tough!), but after digging deeper, I solved them perfectly! ðŸ’ª Sharing this as part of my #LearnInPublic commitment.
