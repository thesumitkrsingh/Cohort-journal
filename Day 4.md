# Day 3 Update: A Long Pause, A New Realization - #HarkiratCohort

It’s been months since my last post on April 3rd—Day 3 of my #HarkiratCohort journey. I’m back with an update, a reflection, and a renewed mindset.

## What I’ve Been Up To
Since April, I took up a job as a waiter to support myself. The long hours were exhausting, and I’ll admit, my laziness got the better of me at times. I struggled to stay consistent with my #TechJourney, often procrastinating on cohort tasks and letting my learning slip.

## What I Learned
Today, I had a moment of clarity: every outcome in my life is the result of my own actions. I realized I’ve been missing *intent* in my work and the art of *ownership*. I wasn’t fully owning my actions—whether it was skipping a study session, half-heartedly doing my waiter job, or not pushing harder in my cohort. This lack of ownership has been holding me back from real growth.

## How I’ll Improve
- **Clear Intent:** I’ll approach every task—coding, learning, or even serving tables—with purpose and focus.
- **Own My Actions:** No more excuses. I’ll take full responsibility for my progress, or lack thereof.
- **Rebuild Consistency:** Small, daily steps to get back on track with my #WebDevelopment goals.

This #LearnInPublic update is me holding myself accountable. I’m ready to grow by owning my journey. How do you stay consistent in your #SelfImprovement or #TechJourney? Open to tips! #HarkiratCohort #PersonalGrowth #Consistency
