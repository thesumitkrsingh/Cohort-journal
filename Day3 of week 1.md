# Day 3: Self-Reflection Over Productivity - #HarkiratCohort

Today, on Day 3 of my #HarkiratCohort journey, I didn’t get much "done" in the usual sense—no code, no wireframes. Instead, I turned inward. I spent 30 minutes in a dark room, no distractions, just me and my thoughts. The question: *What’s stopping me from being consistent?*

## What I Realized
Laziness and procrastination are my roadblocks. These aren’t new—they’ve been with me since childhood, dodging school homework, and now pushing off college assignments. It’s a pattern I can’t ignore if I want to grow.

## The Bigger Picture
I want to build #TechProducts that help people—products rooted in empathy and sympathy. But I can’t do that without fixing myself first. As *7 Habits of Highly Effective People* puts it: "Begin with the end in mind." I need a clear goal to fight procrastination. And "Seek first to understand, then to be understood"—understanding others’ needs starts with understanding myself.

## Lessons Learned
- **Inner Work First:** Self-improvement isn’t just tech skills; it’s breaking habits like laziness.
- **End in Mind:** Defining my purpose (e.g., impactful #WebDevelopment) keeps me driven.
- **Consistency is Key:** Half an hour of self-talk showed me I *can* change—I just need to start.
